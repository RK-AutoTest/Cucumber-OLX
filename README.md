# Cucumber-OLX
This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of skills in Selenium, Java, Maven, the Page Object Model (POM), TestNG, and Cucumber. Its primary focus is on testing the popular OLX websites.

The project includes various test scenarios to validate different functionalities of the OLX website. Two specific test cases are outlined:

Country Selection Test:
This test verifies the functionality of the country dropdown on the OLX website. It ensures that the user can successfully select a country from the dropdown and that the selection is reflected on the website. This validates that the country selection feature functions as intended.

Search Functionality Test:
The project tests the search box on the OLX website to ensure its proper functionality. It validates whether the user is able to enter valid data into the search box and click on the search button. Furthermore, it verifies if the user obtains the desired results based on the search query. This test case is crucial to guarantee that the search feature works correctly, providing users with accurate and relevant search results.

Through this showcase project, the developer demonstrates their expertise in utilizing Selenium for web automation, Java for coding test scripts, Maven for project management, POM for maintaining a structured test framework, TestNG for test case execution and management, and Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) style test scenarios.

The project's objective is to exhibit the developer's ability to automate testing for the OLX website using industry-standard tools and frameworks. It aims to ensure the quality and functionality of the website's core features, such as country selection and search functionality.
